title: "Weekly Meeting"
---

CALST (Co-study Group on Advanced Learning Science and Technology) is an advanced academic community dedicated to fostering deep, ongoing discussion in the fields of learning science and educational technology.

Our weekly meetings serve as a core space for presenting research, exchanging ideas, and building shared understanding—functioning much like a second research seminar for our members.

#### Objective

To provide a consistent and intellectually rigorous forum for collaborative discussion, critical feedback, and shared growth among researchers who are actively engaged in the study of learning and technology.


#### Who Can Join

CALST welcomes the following participants, regardless of age:

- **Undergraduate and Master's Students:** Must plan to pursue a doctoral program, have obtained permission from their academic advisor, and show strong motivation for research and scholarly discussion.
- **Doctoral Students:** Must have approval from their academic advisor and a clear intent to participate actively in both research and community dialogue.
- **Researchers (academic or industry):** Should be actively engaged in research with a focus on producing internationally relevant contributions and a willingness to engage in regular discussion.

Please note that **CALST is not a casual or one-time discussion group**.
We do **not accept participants who only intend to join a few times per year**.
This is a place for **continuous participation and shared commitment**, designed for those who seek to grow together as part of a collaborative academic environment.

#### Schedule and Format

- **When:** Every Thursday, 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm (GMT+9 / JST)
  - This schedule will remain in effect for **the first semester of 2025**.
  - Adjustments may be made at the beginning of each semester.
- **Where:** Online via Discord
- **Format:** Typically includes 2–3 member presentations with Q&A, followed by in-depth open discussions on selected topics.

#### Participation Policy

CALST is a **continuous and collaborative academic group**, not a casual or drop-in community.
We believe that meaningful dialogue can only happen through sustained engagement over time. Therefore, we do **not accept participants who can only join a few times a year**.

Participation is limited to those who are committed to regular involvement.

All members are registered to three platforms:
- CALST mailing list
- Discord (for meetings and discussion)
- Notion (for shared records and resources)

#### How to Join

We accept new members via two pathways:

1. **Open Application**
   If you would like to join CALST, please send a message to our team via the [Contact](/contact) page.
   Your message should include:
   - A short self-introduction
   - A clear statement of your intention to participate **continuously**
   - (Optional) Your current research interests or goals

   The committee will review your message and respond with further instructions.

2. **Invitation by Current Member**
   You may also join through recommendation by an existing member. In such cases, the member should notify the Executive Committee directly.

#### Final Note

CALST is a place for mutual academic growth. If you are looking for a space to challenge your thinking, receive honest feedback, and contribute to an evolving research community—we look forward to hearing from you.

Let’s build this "second seminar" together.
