#### Historical Summary

- 2018-12-18: The first inter-university joint seminar was initiated by Tomoki Aburatani (M2) and Kento Koike (M1), both master's students at the time, marking the beginning of what would evolve into a broader academic community.
- 2020-07-01: Co-organization of the Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) study group by the above two began, with the goal of expanding membership primarily among master's and Ph.D. students within Japan. After that, they held the two-hour meeting continuously for about one to two weeks.
- 2024-04-01: The ITS study group was officially renamed to CALST (Co-study Group on Advanced Learning Science and Technology) to transition to a broader topic and international study community.
